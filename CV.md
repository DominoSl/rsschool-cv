**Convert an array of strings to array of numbers

*Oh no!
Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!
You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.
Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.*

```javascript
function toNumberArray(stringarray){
  return stringarray.map(n => +n)
}
